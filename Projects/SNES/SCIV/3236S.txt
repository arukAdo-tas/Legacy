Well, here it is. This movie is a co-effort between arukAdo, Cardboard, Bablo and scrimpeh. Originally started by Cardboard and Bablo, they played up to Stage 3-3, from where the two of us took over. We end up beating Phil and Genisto's old movie by ~77 seconds, (97 total, since we also left out the dance at the end).
